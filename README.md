Through static and interactive visualizations, we try to answer the below questions:

1.How do prices of listings vary by location?
2.How does the demand for Airbnb rentals fluctuate across the year and over years?
3.Are the demand and prices of the rentals correlated?
4.What are the different types of properties in Toronto? Do they vary by neighborhood?
5.What localities in Toronto are rated highly by guests?
6.What makes a host Super host?
